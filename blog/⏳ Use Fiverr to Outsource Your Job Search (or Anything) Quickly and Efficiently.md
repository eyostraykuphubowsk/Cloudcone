## What Is Fiverr?

Fiverr is the world’s original micro-services freelance marketplace and remains the most popular to this day. It was founded on the idea that everyone has skills and services they can offer, starting at just $5 (a “fiver”). This concept encouraged many first-timers to start selling online, with projects (known as "Gigs") ranging from the creative and fun to the practical.

As Fiverr evolved, it began offering more professional services, including business-focused Gigs like computer programming, marketing campaigns, and more. Fiverr Pro was also introduced, featuring hand-picked professionals vetted by Fiverr for their quality, credibility, and ability to handle larger projects.

Fiverr offers services for virtually any job-search-related need. From resume writing to SEO research, you can get fast, quality results without breaking the bank. Plus, with Fiverr Pro, you have access to vetted professionals for larger and more complex tasks.

## Tips for Success on Fiverr

### 1. Compare Multiple Sellers
Take advantage of Fiverr’s affordability by ordering the same service from multiple freelancers. This allows you to compare results and maximize quality.

Examine seller ratings and feedback to gauge their reliability. Avoid Gigs with overly generic reviews, which may indicate fake feedback.

Contact freelancers before placing an order to test their responsiveness and communication skills. You can also ask for examples of their previous work.

### 4. Stay Available
Ensure timely communication during the project to prevent delays.

### 5. Look for Signs of Quality
High-quality Gigs often include:
   - Informative overviews
   - Sample work (images, videos, or slideshows)
   - Fast delivery times (1-2 days)
   - Recently completed orders

### 6. Consider Time Zones
For time-sensitive projects, choose a freelancer whose working hours overlap with yours.
