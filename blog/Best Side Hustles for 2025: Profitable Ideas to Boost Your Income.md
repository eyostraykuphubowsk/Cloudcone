## How to Evaluate the Profitability of Side Hustles

Before diving into any opportunity, it's important to evaluate its profitability. Here are three key factors to consider:

### 1. **Market Demand**
Researching market demand ensures you're investing in an opportunity with potential customers. Use tools like Google Trends to spot emerging niches or popular searches.

Example:
If "handmade wooden toys" are trending, this could signal a lucrative niche for crafters.

### 2. **Cost vs. Revenue**
Calculate all associated costs—materials, marketing, and fees—against your potential earnings. For example, an online tutor should weigh the costs of educational resources and advertising against the fees they charge per session.

### 3. **Time Investment**
Maximizing returns for your time is key. For instance, a freelance graphic designer earning $500 for a 5-hour project is making $100 per hour, while a rideshare driver earning $100 for the same duration makes $20/hour. Always consider the value of your time.
