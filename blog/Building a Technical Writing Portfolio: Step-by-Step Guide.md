## Challenges in Building a Technical Writing Portfolio

One of the biggest hurdles in creating a portfolio is **confidentiality agreements**. Many technical writers cannot share documentation they've created for previous employers or clients due to legal restrictions. So, how can you showcase your work while respecting these limitations?

## Two Simple Methods to Build Your Technical Writing Portfolio

Below are two effective ways to build your portfolio, whether you're a seasoned technical writer or a beginner.

### Method 1: Document Open-Source Projects

Creating documentation for open-source projects is an excellent way to contribute to the community and build your portfolio simultaneously. Open-source projects are publicly available, and teams often welcome skilled technical writers to help with documentation.

#### Steps to Get Started:
1. Find open-source projects that need documentation.
2. Contact project stakeholders to volunteer your services.
3. Create high-quality documentation, such as user manuals, FAQs, or tutorials.

#### Recommended Open-Source Projects:
- [Open Source Projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)
- [Ubuntu Documentation](https://ubuntu.com/community/documentation)
- [LibreOffice Docs](https://documentation.libreoffice.org/)
- [Reddit's List of Open-Source Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/gcfmuh/a_list_of_open_source_projects_with_volunteer/)

> **Note:** This method is better suited for experienced technical writers, as open-source projects often require you to work independently without much guidance.

### Method 2: Document Products You Use

This method is ideal for beginners and entry-level technical writers. By documenting products you already use, you can quickly create a portfolio while honing your skills.

#### Steps to Build Your Portfolio:
1. Choose a product, software, or application you use frequently.
2. Review the existing documentation for usability, readability, and quality.
3. Identify areas for improvement.
4. Create your own documentation, such as:
   - User guides
   - Troubleshooting manuals
   - Glossaries
5. Revise and refine your content to ensure clarity and conciseness.
6. Publish your work on a blog or upload PDF versions to a file-sharing service like Google Drive.
7. Share portfolio links on platforms like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr), or [Upwork](https://upwork.com).
8. Repeat this process for at least 10 different products to diversify your portfolio.

> **Pro Tip:** Follow a consistent style guide to maintain professionalism and uniformity in your documentation.

## Benefits of Documenting Products You Use

1. **Minimal Research Required**  
   Since you're already familiar with the product, you can spend less time researching and more time writing.

2. **Low Dependency on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**  
   As the product's user, you are the SME. This eliminates the challenge of extracting information from external sources.

3. **Skill Development**  
   - Create polished documentation.
   - Improve your writing and editing skills.
   - Build confidence for job interviews and client pitches.

Each documented product adds a valuable item to your portfolio, bringing you closer to becoming a successful technical writer.
