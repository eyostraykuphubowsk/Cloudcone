# Where to Find and Hire Freelance Web Designers? (Expert Guide)

If you're in need of a professional, stylish website for your business, hiring a freelance web designer is often the best way to achieve your vision without breaking the bank. Freelance designers offer flexibility, expertise, and affordability compared to full-time hires.

However, finding the right designer can be a challenge. This guide will help you discover where to hire reliable and talented freelance web designers and ensure a smooth hiring process.

## Do You Need a Web Designer or Web Developer?

Before jumping into the hiring process, it's crucial to determine whether you need a **web designer** or a **web developer**.

### What Web Designers Do

Web designers focus on the visual and aesthetic aspects of a website. They handle:
- Layout and design
- Color schemes
- Typography and branding

They typically use tools like Adobe Creative Suite to create mockups and prototypes. If your project prioritizes **branding, user experience, and visual appeal**, hiring a web designer is the right choice.

### What Web Developers Do

Web developers focus on functionality and coding. Their responsibilities include:
- Writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages
- Database management

If you need advanced functionality, interactivity, or back-end support, a web developer will meet your technical needs. Some professionals combine both skill sets, but it’s important to understand your project's primary focus.
